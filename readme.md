Volunteering
============

A mockup of a "[Farmville](http://farmville.com/) in real life" idea to encourage hyperlocal volunteering in local communities.

This slowly grew over three hackathons in London:

* [TechMeetups HTML5 App hackathon](http://www.meetup.com/london-silicon-roundabout/events/59072812/) July 2012 by City Uni students and friends
* [Urban Prototyping hackathon](http://uplondon.net/th_event/hackathon/) April 2013 at [Imperial College](http://imperialhub.org/xwiki/bin/view/Imperial+Hub/Volunteering+Opportunities/)
  * [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u3fmOotVN-4SkLnQbPnhAAPBHclD-tHWHtCn1HUEjmU/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000)
  * [2-page business case](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QjoUJlIGHWEpaBh0ECT09W9JrpBfVXuNE-lzrTAmyAQ/pub)
* [Yahoo! Hack Europe London hackathon](http://hacks.developer.yahoo.com/hacks/yahoo-hack-europe-london/event_9) April 2013
  * Data-driven [Mustache/jQuery](http://mustache.github.io/) listings fed from [Yahoo!](http://developer.yahoo.com/everything.html) [Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/) and [YQL](http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/?q=select%20*%20from%20geo.placefinder%20where%20text%3D%22EC2A%204BX%2C%20GB%22&env=store%3A%2F%2Fdatatables.org%2Falltableswithkeys) back-end using the [geo.PlaceFinder](http://developer.yahoo.com/boss/geo/docs/free_YQL.html#table_pf) and [geo.PlaceMaker](http://developer.yahoo.com/boss/geo/docs/free_YQL.html#table_pm) tables and an [import.io Mix](http://import.io/api/reference/we-will-gather/6f5f0ba6-0940-48f6-950d-04ddd314420f) to federate searches of different charities' websites

It is going to showcase at [Digital Shoreditch](https://tickets.digitalshoreditch.com/2013/what-tech-city/) in May 2013 with the aim of recruiting volunteers to build a production version for soft-launch in [student communities](http://studenthubs.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Local+Hubs) later in 2013. We are also aware of these organisations that might get involved:
* [Open Data Institute](http://www.theodi.org/) to advise on federated search
* [Nesta](http://www.nesta.org.uk/areas_of_work/public_services_lab/giving_and_social_action/csa_innovationfund), who funded [#WeWillGather](http://www.wewillgather.co.uk/volunteer-projects#simpleContained2) and are [looking for a new owner](http://www.youthnet.org/2013/03/information-about-do-it-transfer-process/) for the [Do-it](http://www.do-it.org.uk/search/opportunities?unit=km&distance=2&location=South+Kensington) [database](http://www.youthnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Overview-of-Do-it.pdf) and app. They have a hyper-local theme running.
