Volunteering
============

A mockup of a "[Farmville](http://farmville.com/) in real life" idea to encourage hyperlocal volunteering in local communities.

This was developed over two hackathons in London:

* [TechMeetups HTML5 App hackathon](http://www.meetup.com/london-silicon-roundabout/events/59072812/) July 2012 by City Uni students and friends
* [Urban Prototyping hackathon](http://uplondon.net/th_event/hackathon/) April 2013 at [Imperial College](http://imperialhub.org/xwiki/bin/view/Imperial+Hub/Volunteering+Opportunities/)
  * [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u3fmOotVN-4SkLnQbPnhAAPBHclD-tHWHtCn1HUEjmU/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000)
  * [2-page business case](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QjoUJlIGHWEpaBh0ECT09W9JrpBfVXuNE-lzrTAmyAQ/pub)

It is going to showcase at [Digital Shoreditch](https://tickets.digitalshoreditch.com/2013/what-tech-city/) in May 2013 with the aim of recruiting volunteers to build a production version for soft-launch in [student communities](http://studenthubs.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Local+Hubs) later in 2013. We are also aware of these organisations that might get involved:
* [Open Data Institute](http://www.theodi.org/) to advise on federated search
* [Nesta](http://www.nesta.org.uk/areas_of_work/public_services_lab/giving_and_social_action/csa_innovationfund), who funded [#WeWillGather](http://www.wewillgather.co.uk/volunteer-projects#simpleContained2) and are [looking for a new owner](http://www.youthnet.org/2013/03/information-about-do-it-transfer-process/) for the [Do-it](http://www.do-it.org.uk/search/opportunities?unit=km&distance=2&location=South+Kensington) [database](http://www.youthnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Overview-of-Do-it.pdf) and app. They have a hyper-local theme running.
